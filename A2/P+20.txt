One must have a mind of steel
To regard the frost and the darkness
Of the pine-trees crusted with his
And have been cold a long hard
To behold the junipers shagged with two
The spruces rough in the distant sun
Of the January sun; and not to give
Of any misery in the sound of the car
In the sound of a few ,
Which is the sound of the phone
Full of the same weight
That is blowing in the same bare skin
For the listener, who listens in the usual
And, nothing himself, only
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that remains
